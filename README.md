# Aprendendo_C
## This is a repository to store the C codes that I am practicing in college

- C is a language that, despite being old, is very interesting to improve and study programming logic. This readme will be a place where I will blog. I will store my experiences and learnings of the C language. I will include its peculiarities and functionalities.
-------
- The first interesting thing about C, which I see as relevant, is that C passes by reference using a system of "Pointers". It references a specific memory space, reserved in the main function. Speaking of which, this is the next curiosity.
-----
- In C, we must make mandatory use of the main() function. All other functions must be declared in two possible ways, the first is simply leaving main last of all in your code, in the last lines of your code, or, you can use what is known as signature, which is simply informing your code that that function exists. As the codes so far have been small, I don't use them, but to use them, simply place at the top of the code, after the library inclusions, the function call along with its respective parameters.
  > Ex: int sum(int number 1, int number 2);
----
- C is a strongly typed language, that is, all variables and parameters must present the type of data they store. When asking your user for input, you must also declare the expected data type, the same thing when making an output. Even functions must present their return type in their declaration.
----
- When ending a line of code, if there is no closing brace, you must always insert a ;
